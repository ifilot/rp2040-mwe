# RP2040 Minimal Working Example

Slightly adjusted version of the [minimal design example](
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf)
of Raspberry Pi LTD. Components have been added for the assembly service
of JLCPCB, choosing - where possible - as many basic components to save
costs.

BOM and placement files as well as the GERBER files are added available
for easy ordering.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I did not design this PCB. I merely added the part IDs for JLCPCB and
> generated the BOM and CPL files. The original designs are made by
> Raspberry Pi LTD and it is highly recommended to always check their
> website for the latest version. See the link above.
